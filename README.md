Nested Form Fun
===============

Based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18575039/how-can-i-use-accepts-nested-attributes-with-the-habtm we want to see if https://github.com/gabrielhilal/nested_form will support nested forms where relations are both created and destroyed.

Used the following to generate this

```
rails new nested_form_test
rails g scaffold Category name:string
rails g scaffold Organisation name:string
rails g model CategoryOrganisations organisation:references category:references
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

to support the following:

```
